[Data Council](https://www.datacouncil.ai/), known for putting on wonderful 
events that attract the best and brightest speakers in the data ecosystem, will 
be holding its only [conference of 2023](https://www.datacouncil.ai/austin) in 
Austin, Texas, on March 28-30th, and OpenLineage will be there. 

Among the speakers at this year's event will be OpenLineage Project Lead and 
[Astronomer](https://astronomer.io) Chief Architect [Julien Le Dem](https://www.datacouncil.ai/talks/ten-years-of-building-open-source-standards?hsLang=en).

Also, we are planning an OpenLineage event for conference attendees. Join Julien

at the [AT&T Hotel and Conference Center](https://meetattexas.com/hotel) on the

You can expect a wide-ranging, open-ended discussion of the past, present and
